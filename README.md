# Audio captioning 

Welcome to the repository of the audio captioning.

----
## Setting up the code

To start using the audio captioning, firstly you
have to set-up the code. Please **note bold** that the code in this repository
is tested with Python 3.9.

To set-up the code, you have to do the following: 

  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Use either pip to install dependencies
  
Use the following command to clone this repository at your terminal:

````shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/Vikhyat-1820/AUDIO-CAPTIONING.git
````

All the required libraries are included in requirement.txt.

## DataSet

The dataset used for audio captioning is clotho dataset. Clotho dataset is freely available online at the Zenodo platform. You can find Clotho at [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3490684#.YQFQkI4zYrM).

## Training

Step 1 :- Run ```` python Text Preprocessing/Text_preprocessing.py```` in terminal, this will create two files in features folder.

Step 2 :- Run ```` python Models/model.py ````. It will start training the model and create MODEL.H5 in models folder.
